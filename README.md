The program also informs whether the user needs to gain or lose weight to reach a healthy range.

This project was created to practice:
- Programming logic
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Mathematical calculations
- User input handling
- Code readability and organization

It is a beginner-friendly project focused on backend fundamentals using Python.
